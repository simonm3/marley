for nigeria challenge

no data is perfect
    it is out of date
    it was collected for a different purpose
    the people collecting it had an agenda
    the quality of collection is variable and depends on samples
luckily we don't need perfect but the better the data, the better the solution, the more people we can help for our budget.

within 2 weeks we had a minimal solution. this is immediately useful:
    provides a skeleton pipeline that works but each stage can be improved
    provides visualisations that show what is possible and can be improved
    used only 2 data sources - we can add more later
    used the first reasonable data sources found
already adds value compared with "zero data". but we know we can do better......

issues with initial data
    population
        census is unreliable
            data drives spending so local officials have an incentive to make numbers bigger
            there is corruption so in some areas the census numbers may be made up
            detailed data is not published so it is hard to check the numbers are realistic
            even total population for the country can never be known exactly
            quality of data collection is variable
            it is out of date
        allocating census population to smaller areas is usually based on buildings but this is unreliable
            a city rooftop may be a high rise with 1000 people or a warehouse with none
            rural buildings may be abandoned as people move to the city
            density of people per building varies widely
        leading population models did not fit our application
            google earth showed forests and deserts where the leading population models showed people
            google earth showed large settlements with apparently no population and not marked on google maps
    electricity
        in surveys the definition of who has electricity is unclear
            some are on the grid but not connected
            some can access electricity in their village but not in their house
            some offically are connected to the grid but it has not worked in 3 years since the transformer broke
            some have connection but it only works some days for some hours
        satellite data on nightime lights is not perfect either
            individual months can show significant variation e.g. one month shows a whole region lit which is dark normally
            some roads are lit by car headlights - we can see on google earth there are no street lamps.
            satellites vary in their sensitivity
    the grid
        electricity companies do not have a complete map of their powerlines
        parts of the grid exist but may not actually work

solutions
    population
        reviewed and validated more than a dozen different models
        selected a bottom up model based on surveys rather than spreading the census
        this model was tested/refined by a vaccination programme giving confidence that it works on the ground
        it also matched well with manual estimates based on looking at buildings on google earth
    electricity
        combined multiple months and satellite sources
        still not perfect and we had to make manual trade-offs but we don't need perfect
    the grid
        a neural network model combined with manual checking was available which looked most realistic
        it is often the case that combining complex models with human checking produces the best results
